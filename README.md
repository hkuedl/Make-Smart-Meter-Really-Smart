# Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning

This is the codebase for our paper "Introducing Edge Intelligence to Smart Meters via Federated Split Learning".

## Overview

Low-cost smart meters are ubiquitous in smart grids. Enabling resource-constraint smart meters to perform deep learning is quite challenging. Our end-edge-cloud framework reveals a new path for edge intelligence on smart meters. It improves 95.6% memory footprint, 94.8% training time, and 50% communication overhead, achieving comparable or even superior forecasting accuracy to that of conventional methods trained on high-capacity servers. We provide code for established experimental and simulation platforms.

## Dataset

The current version supports the following datasets and tasks are saved in `dataset`:
- BDG2 - Building load forecasting
- CBTs - Residential load forecasting

## Experimental platform

You can build the **experimental platform** with three components: microcontrollers, personal computers, and a tower server. `experimental_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on them.
> **Note:** The microcontrollers are coded in  **C language** and the computers and tower server are coded in **Python**.

To use the provided code, you are supposed to:
- Load the dataset `dataset/BDG2_dataset/.csv` or `dataset/CBTs_dataset/.csv` into microcontrollers.
- Compile `experimental_platform/smart_meter/USER/.uvprojx` and download the code to the flash memory of microcontrollers.
- Run `experimental_platform/edge_server/Edge_server` on computers.
- Run `experimental_platform/cloud_server/Cloud_server` on server.
> **Note:** Please ensure the microcontroller is configured with at least 192 KB of SRAM and 1 MB of FLASH.
> 
> **Note:** Please ensure the communication network is connected and stable before use.
 
## Simulation platform

You can also build the **simulation platform** with the tower server. `simulation_platform` is loaded with the code deployed on it.

To use the provided code, please run `simulation_platform/Test.py` to obtain the results:

`server.centralized_train()`: Cen

`server.local_train()`: Local

`server.fed_train()`: FedAvg

`server.fed_prox_train()`: FedProx

`server.split_train()`: Split

`server.sflv1_train()`: SFLV1

`server.sflv2_train()`: SFLV2

`server.distillation_train()`: Proposed
